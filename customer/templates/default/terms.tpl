<h1>Terms &amp; conditions</h1>
<h3>The {$CCMAINTITLE} Subscriber Agreement</h3>

<p>By registering for, activating, making use of, or by paying for {$CCMAINTITLE}’s site or services you acknowledge having read and agreed to these terms, and you represent that there is no legal impediment to your entering or being bound by this agreement.</p>
<h3>Billing, Pricing and Charges</h3>
<p>Usage of {$CCMAINTITLE}’s services will be charged according to the current price list as made available on the {$CCMAINTITLE} site. Changes to our pricing shall become effective immediately upon posting to the site.</p>
<p>{$CCMAINTITLE} accepts no liability for any charges assessed by a third party provider when used in conjunction with {$CCMAINTITLE}'s services. Your access to and use of a service provided by a third party provider is subject to the provider's terms and conditions. As soon as your call is connected to a phone number provided by {$CCMAINTITLE}, the call may be charged regardless of whether you are connected to the receiver of the call.</p>
<p>The rates that will be charged for calls will be based on a rate which is exclusive of any applicable taxes and surcharges. This rate will be the rate advertised on the {$CCMAINTITLE} website at the time of the call.</p>
<p>Cost of call calculation will be based on the length of the call rounded up to the next nearest full minute.</p>
<p>Payment for {$CCMAINTITLE}’s services is billed on a pre-pay basis, unless otherwise agreed by both parties. You agree that our services will not be provisioned until sufficient pre-payment has been made, and that service may be terminated immediately if sufficient pre-payment has not been made. It is your ongoing responsibility to ensure that your account maintains the necessary balance to provision the service.</p>
<p>Refunds will only be made for orders within 90 days of completion. No refunds of less than &#36;3 will be made against each order. Refunds are subject to an administration fee of the greater of 10% or &#36;1.</p>
<p>You agree that {$CCMAINTITLE} can expire any credit that remains unused for a rolling period of 365 days. Such expiration renders the balance non-refundable.</p>
<p>Customers are limited to a single active subscription to any one destination within a billing period. We reserve the right to cancel subscriptions and accounts without refunding unused minutes where we suspect users have created multiple accounts to circumvent this limit.</p>
<h3>Measuring Usage</h3>
<p>You agree that {$CCMAINTITLE}’s records are conclusive evidence of your use of the site and service. Furthermore, you acknowledge that these records will be used to calculate charges incurred.</p>
<p>You agree to be held fully responsible for all use of and fees related to your account, and accept full liability and responsibility for the actions of anyone who uses the site or service via your account, whether authorised or unauthorised, except when unauthorised use is solely attributed to an act or omission on the part of {$CCMAINTITLE}.</p>

Further, you agree to reimburse us for all of our costs and expenses related to the defence of any such claims, including legal fees, unless such claims are based on our wilful misconduct or gross negligence.</p>
<p>You must notify {$CCMAINTITLE} within thirty (30) days of the date on your credit card or debit card statement if you dispute any {$CCMAINTITLE} charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived.</p>
<p>Incoming numbers are meant for average retail customer use and will be restricted to 2 incoming concurrent calls. This means that high volumes of incoming calls are not allowed. Incoming numbers are not to be used for call centers or business use where a large amount of incoming calls come in to each number. There will be a &#36;0.01 surcharge assessed on a per call basis for each call to any incoming number that exceeds 100 calls per day per number.</p>
<h3>Internet Phone (VOIP)</h3>
<p>The Service requires Equipment, or software obtained through {$CCMAINTITLE} or a third party, that allows you to place and receive calls by using your high-speed Internet connection. {$CCMAINTITLE} does not provide or support your high-speed Internet connection, which you need to supply at your own expense. We recommend that your high-speed connection have a capacity of at least 120 Kbps upstream and downstream.</p>
<p>Since the Service depends on your high-speed connection, the correct configuration of the Equipment, and an adequate power supply, {$CCMAINTITLE} does not guarantee continuous availability. You acknowledge and understand that the Service will not function in the absence of electrical power or if there is an interruption of your high-speed Internet connection. A power failure may require you to reset or reconfigure your Equipment or other equipment in order to restore the Service.</p>

<p>Destinations included in the free test call promotion will be totally at the discretion of {$CCMAINTITLE}. Not all destinations will be included in the promotion and can change at anytime without notice.</p>
<p>Credit will expire 60 days from account creation if it has not been used. Your free call will be removed if you add credit before making your free call.</p>

<p>Customers purchasing a plan part-way through the month will be asked to make a pro-rated payment and may be asked to cover the cost of the following month up-front.</p>
<p>Subscription payments will be taken in advance monthly 7 days prior to the end of the month.</p>
<p>If we can’t take payment within the 7 days prior to the end of the month your unlimited service plan will be cancelled. To re-activate your Subscription you’ll be required to pay the set-up fee again.</p>
